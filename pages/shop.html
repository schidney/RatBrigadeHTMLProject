              Pumpkin is very nice. He’s very friendly and very good with kids and just very cool in general. He likes cooking but only knows how to make pumpkin pie. He will do his very best to help you with your chores even if he’s kind of small. He’s a good babysitter, too. Every rat expert who has viewed him would completely recommend him to you.

              Spooky’s favorite holiday is Halloween, and he likes to dress up as a ghost. He will count down the days until Halloween for you so you will never be unprepared. In the morning he will greet you and tell you it’s only 188 days until Halloween. Spooky is a very good companion if you like staying up late because nighttime is his favorite time.</p>

              Gary might have wings, but he is definitely a rat. Just one that does not act like a rat. He might sleep upside down, but it is fine. Don’t worry about it. He scares away bugs and will protect your home at night, like a scary guard dog except he’s a rat. With wings.</p>

              Gorflax the World Eater has to be fed every 6 hours or else he will eat the world. He is fully trained though so it is worth the risk.  Gorflax the World Eater is the coolest rat because he is tiny and fits in your pocket so you can travel with him, and he’s very polite and stays in your pocket. He’s hungry all the time and likes all food. He also likes warm places and being held. </p>

                He definatly eats a lot, he actually ate my desk when i forgot to feed him on the 6th hour, but I still think he's worth it.

              Midnight is Spooky’s twin brother. He’s really average for a rat. He doesn’t know any tricks and likes to sleep all day and chew on things at night. If you just want a normal rat because you are boring, then he is the rat for you. </p>

              Snowball just really likes to yell. He doesn’t yell in a mean way; he just thinks its fun to yell and he’s probably right. He also likes telling people what to do. If you’re indecisive then he could be really helpful because he’s really good at making decisions and then telling you to do that. </p>

                He's very loud but otherwise a very nice rat. He likes to yell at company when they come over.
