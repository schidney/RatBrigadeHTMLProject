        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          &emsp; Have you ever been sad? Bored? Lonely? What you may need is a
          rat. Rats are small animals that enjoy attention and friends, and one
          could be your new best friend. The company The Rat's Nest was founded
          in 1987 when our very own rat experts noticed a very tragic lack of
          rats in the average person's life.
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; The Rat's Nest's goal is to put multiple rats into every single
          house in the world. Our rats are even better than your average pet
          store rat because ours are fully trained and can do all kinds of cool
          things. They'll even help you with things you may need help with. A
          new rat could be a whole new start for you.
