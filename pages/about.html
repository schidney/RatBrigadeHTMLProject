          &emsp; Have you ever been sad? Bored? Lonely? What you may need is a
          rat. Rats are small animals that enjoy attention and friends, and one
          could be your new best friend. The company The Rat's Nest was founded
          in 1987 when our very own rat experts noticed a very tragic lack of
          rats in the average person's life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          &emsp; The Rat's Nest's goal is to put multiple rats into every single
          house in the world. Our rats are even better than your average pet
          store rat because ours are fully trained and can do all kinds of cool
          things. They'll even help you with things you may need help with. A
          new rat could be a whole new start for you.
        </p>
        <br />

          &emsp; The website we are comparing ours to is Amazon. Ours is better
          because our business focuses on one specific thing so that we can
          guarantee only the best products. We also properly pay our employees
          including the rats and don't force them to work in bad conditions. Our
          website has a fun rat themed background and easy to look at colors.
          Our website is more enjoyable to look at and while it doesn't have
          same day delivery, we value the health of the environment and the
          safety of our rats. Money given to us through the purchase of rats
          also goes to making the world better for all rats instead of our
          business owners' bank account. Overall, our website is much better
          than Amazon and should be where you spend all your money from now on.
